    "wall_description": "The man (Vincent Van Gogh) has painted himself off center from the left, turned three-quarter view facing right, looking straight ahead. He’s fair skinned with close cropped auburn hair, short beard and moustache, closed lips, intense deep-set green eyes, and chiseled features. He wears a brown vest and jacket, white shirt underneath with a large brown button in the center, and no tie. The aqua green background color is subtly worked into the shadows of the skin tones and shirt. Van Gogh’s energetic brush strokes are rich with colors and textures and follow the surfaces of every shape in the painting."

    "wall_description": "In the 1850s Degas frequently used himself as a model, but he made only one self-portrait in a print medium, of which only ten known impressions of the first three states exist. Through successive stages of biting the plate, Degas built up the darks gradually, using layers of crosshatching to achieve large areas of tone. The third and most successful state—like this impression—is the most dramatic due to additional tone and etched lines on the face, hat, and coat. An especially beautiful sheet, the museum’s <em>Self-Portrait</em> was printed from a plate carefully wiped to create atmospheric, chiaroscuro effects that allow the clearly drawn eyes to look directly at the viewer, achieving a psychologically powerful and intense portrait of the artist at age 23. This impression was inscribed by the artist to his friend, the painter and sculptor Paul Albert Bartholomé."

He has wavy grey hair that is combed to one side and flows to his short beard and mustache. He has heavy eyelids and a prominent long nose, with mouth slightly ajar as if preparing to speak. He is leaning on a pedestal with his left elbow, with the top of his hand slightly visible in a relaxed posture. The background is in shadow, with suggestions of a library bookshelf and a sculptural portrait bust on the pedestal he leans on."
