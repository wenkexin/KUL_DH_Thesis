Dolard, a portrait painter, may have offered photographs to prospective clients of lesser means. In this image, possibly made as an advertisement for his studio, he identifies himself as a painter, surrounded by the tools of the trade. The coat and the hookah suggest an interest in orientalism, a fashion that occupied many mid-19th-century artists. A remarkable technical achievement, this whole-plate image required Dolard to remain motionless for well over a minute, at least 30 times longer than the exposure for the smaller plates in the case below.","orientation":"left"},

Through successive stages of biting the plate, Degas built up the darks gradually, using layers of crosshatching to achieve large areas of tone. The third and most successful state—like this impression—is the most dramatic due to additional tone and etched lines on the face, hat, and coat. An especially beautiful sheet, the museum’s <em>Self-Portrait</em> was printed from a plate carefully wiped to create atmospheric, chiaroscuro effects that allow the clearly drawn eyes to look directly at the viewer, achieving a psychologically powerful and intense portrait of the artist at age 23. This impression was inscribed by the artist to his friend, the painter and sculptor Paul Albert Bartholomé.","orientation":"left"},
