  {"objectID":160087,"title":"Self-Portrait in Painting Studio","artist":"Camille Dolard","gender":"male","culture":"France","date":1843,"primaryImage":"https://openaccess-cdn.clevelandart.org/1997.56/1997.56_web.jpg","classification":"Photograph","medium":"daguerreotype (full-plate)","museumURL":"https://clevelandart.org/art/1997.56","filename":"1997.56_web.jpg","from":"Cleveland Museum of Art","wall_description":"Many of the best early photographers were artists who put their training in figural arrangement, light and shadow, and composition to good use in the new medium. Dolard, a portrait painter, may have offered photographs to prospective clients of lesser means. In this image, possibly made as an advertisement for his studio, he identifies himself as a painter, surrounded by the tools of the trade. The coat and the hookah suggest an interest in orientalism, a fashion that occupied many mid-19th-century artists. A remarkable technical achievement, this whole-plate image required Dolard to remain motionless for well over a minute, at least 30 times longer than the exposure for the smaller plates in the case below.","orientation":"left"}

In this self-portrait negative, the elegantly dressed photo-grapher stood in an animated profile pose. With great success, Robert exploited the inherent softness of the paper negative and its ability to render broad areas of light and shadow.\r\n","orientation":"other"}

The man’s face is well-lit and in three-quarter view, his gaze looking outward. He has wavy grey hair that is combed to one side and flows to his short beard and mustache. He has heavy eyelids and a prominent long nose, with mouth slightly ajar as if preparing to speak. He is leaning on a pedestal with his left elbow, with the top of his hand slightly visible in a relaxed posture. The background is in shadow, with suggestions of a library bookshelf and a sculptural portrait bust on the pedestal he leans on.","orientation":"right"}
