Throughout art history, self-portraits have been a time-tested practice for mainstream artists. Surmounting medium and style, self-portraits have become pervasive in every major movement, from the Italian Renaissance to the post- modern and contemporary periods. To illustrate the prevalence of these portraits, I have collected self-portraits from some of the world's most famous museums.

Through a comprehensive selection of self-portraits, I explore the curious custom of expressing the self through visual art. The visualisation is designed as in a scrollable manner and divided into four sections:

  The first section works as an introduction part, apart from the cover page, this part also gives the background information about the visualisation project. In this way, viewers can have a general look at the artworks of the whole collection, which are divided into four categories by the posing orientation of the portraits.
  
  The second section demonstrates the timeline of all the self-portraits in the collection, and meanwhile briefly introduced the history of self-portraits as an art genre. I also intended to illustrate the ageing processing display about Rembrandt van Rijn, in the collection, he has contributed about 30 self- portraits and the time span of which across from about 40 years.
  
  Then in the third part, I listed the ratio of male to female artists, and then I introduced each of the female self-portrait separately. In addition, I've listed possible reasons why women's self-portraits are disproportionately different from men's self-portraits.

  The last section visualises the mediums of these self-portraits, and specifically give information about the changes in medium brought about by the advent of the camera.
